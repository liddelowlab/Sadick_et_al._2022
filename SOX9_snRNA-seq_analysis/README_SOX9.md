#Analysis of snRNA-seq dataset generated from sorting human, post-mortem nuclei based on SOX9 protein levels

In order to improve astrocyte capture rates, we attempted astrocyte enrichment via SOX9 immunolabeling and sorting, and compared both SOX9-positive and SOX9-negative sorted nuclei.

Pilot donor cohort (labeled as SOX9_pilot): 5 de-identified human donor prefrontal cortex samples (NS patients, N = 3; AD patients, N = 2).

Analysis completed using primarily Biocondutor/Seurat packages.
