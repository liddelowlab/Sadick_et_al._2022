#Analysis of snRNA-seq dataset generated from sorting human, post-mortem nuclei based on LIM Homeobox 2 (LHX2)-positive and NeuN-negative protein levels

In order to improve astrocyte capture rates, we optimized a dual immunolabeling strategy pioneered by Nott and colleagues (Nott et al., 2019) by immunolabeling and sorting samples based on LHX2-positive and NeuN-negative signal. Using this strategy, we enriched for astrocytes, maintained similar yields of oligodendrocytes, and primarily depleted neurons.

Total donor cohort (labeled as LEN_all): 16 de-identified human donor prefrontal cortex samples (NS patients, N = 6; AD patients, N = 10).
Final donor cohort (labeled as LEN_final): 14 de-identified human donor prefrontal cortex samples (NS patients, N = 5; AD patients, N = 9).

Analysis completed using primarily Biocondutor/Seurat packages.
Differential gene expression and pathway analysis completed using edgeR package paired with zinbwave-generated observational weights.
