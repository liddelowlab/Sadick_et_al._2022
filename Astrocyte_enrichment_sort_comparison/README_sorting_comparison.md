#Analysis of snRNA-seq dataset comparing sorting strategies to enrich for astrocytic nuclei

In order to improve astrocyte capture rates, we compared two different astrocyte enrichment sorting methods: (1) SOX9-positive sorting versus (2) LIM Homeobox 2(LHX2)-positive and NeuN-negative sorting. One donor was sorted using both methods to cross-compare our ability to improve astrocyte enrichment in generated snRNA-seq datasets.

Pilot donor cohort (labeled as sort_comparison): 1 de-identified human donor prefrontal cortex samples (NS patients, N = 1).
Conditions evaluated: SOX9-positive, SOX9-negative, and LHX2-positive/NeuN-negative sorted nuclei.

Analysis completed using primarily Biocondutor/Seurat packages.
