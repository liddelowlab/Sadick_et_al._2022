#Analysis of integrated multi-datasets comparing all astrocytes or all oligodendrocytes captured

Once only astrocyte and oligodendrocyte Seurat objects were created for each dataset, we merged either all astrocyte- or oligodendrocyte-specific objects to create two multi-dataset objects in order to directly compare between datasets.

Datasets evaluated: Mathys et al. (2019), Grubman et al. (2019), Zhou et al. (2020), and our generated snRNA-seq dataset (LEN_final).

Analysis completed using primarily Biocondutor/Seurat packages.
